# AI-Enhanced-Breach-and-Attack-Simulation-Tools

## Problem Statement

Cyberattacks are growing in frequency and sophistication, putting organizations at constant risk. Traditional security testing methods (like manual penetration testing) are resource-intensive, infrequent, and often miss new attack techniques.

There is a need for an automated, continuous, and realistic way to test and validate security defenses.

This tool (SKYNET) simulates real-world cyberattacks, generates synthetic security logs mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and leverages AI for anomaly detection and incident narrative generation. It enables security teams, students, and researchers to proactively identify gaps in their defensesâ€”all without risking real systems or sensitive data.
