
# AI-Enhanced Breach and Attack Simulation Tools

## Problem Statement

Cyberattacks are growing in frequency and sophistication, putting organizations at constant risk. Traditional security testing methods (like manual penetration testing) are resource-intensive, infrequent, and often miss new attack techniques.

There is a need for an automated, continuous, and realistic way to test and validate security defenses.

This tool simulates real-world cyberattacks, generates synthetic security logs mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and leverages AI for anomaly detection and incident narrative generation. It enables security teams, students, and researchers to proactively identify gaps in their defensesâ€”all without risking real systems or sensitive data.

## Python File Overview

- `mitre_mapping.py`:  
  Maps security events to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques.

- `attack_scenarios.py`:  
  Contains predefined attack chains (e.g., Credential Theft, Ransomware).

- `log_generator.py`:  
  Generates synthetic logs from attack scenarios, with MITRE mapping and contextual details.

- `breach_narrator.py`:  
  Uses an AI language model to generate a human-readable narrative of the simulated attack.

- `anomaly_detector.py`:  
  Applies machine learning (Isolation Forest) to detect anomalies in the generated logs.
